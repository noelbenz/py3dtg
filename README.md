
Something I spent a night working on mostly for fun. Part of the goal was to use this to
generate a memory mountain image for an assignment since I didn't have Excel. Unfortunately,
the deadline was nearing and I resorted to using another program instead.
After completing the assignment I came back and "finished" this. I used my knowledge of how
graphics cards render geometry (at a very basic level) to generate a simple 3d terrain graph.
The result is a slow program with no configuration options, but it's something.
